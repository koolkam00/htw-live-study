    "Use the producer's observed_at archive hour only when it is within 30 minutes of the supplied scheduled local start; either nearest hour is accepted at an exact half-hour tie. Temperature, dew point, humidity and wind must agree with that hour. Warming is temperature exactly four hourly readings later minus temperature at that start hour; no runner's finish time determines the window. Supplied start times may be approximate or refer to elite rather than mass starts.",

Course denotes the supplied city, not a verified historical route. Course fixed effects are removed by within-course centering.",
    "Report each weather coefficient multiplied by that exposure's observed edition interquartile range (75th minus 25th percentile). This is a conditional regression contrast, not a prediction that sets dew point beyond the physically supported temperature range. The other modeled variables are held constant.",

The fixed seed is 20260911; 6,000 draws produce percentile intervals at 98.333333% confidence, an approximate Bonferroni adjustment for the three screened exposures. At least 95% of draws must have full rank. Repeated runners across courses are not separately clustered.",

A supported association additionally needs an interval excluding zero, an absolute IQR estimate of at least 1 percentage point and unchanged direction in every leave-one-course-out refit. A precise null requires the entire interval and every leave-one-course-out estimate strictly inside ±1 percentage point. This 1-point threshold is a prespecified practical publication threshold, not a physiological boundary or a claim that smaller changes never matter to runners. All three screen results remain in the audit, including withheld candidates.",
    "This is an exploratory, adjusted edition-level association among eligible finishers. It does not establish a weather penalty, an individual forecast or a causal effect. Field composition, fitness, opening congestion, race organization, route changes and unmeasured conditions remain possible explanations. The opening 0–20 km baseline can itself be affected by weather and congestion. Runners who did not finish or lack valid splits are not represented.",
    "Relative humidity changes with temperature. Dew point is the modeled moisture exposure; the raw humidity percentage is retained for context. Wind speed gives no runner-specific headwind or tailwind without a valid historical route, direction and personal exposure timeline. Scheduled-start weather is not personal wave-start weather.",
